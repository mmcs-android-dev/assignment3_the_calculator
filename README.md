# Assignment #3. The Calculator

The assignment is to make your first Android application.

The basic structure of the app is already present in the repository.

The connection between ViewModel and Layout is implemented with [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding).

The functional part of the view model is described in the Calculator interface.
